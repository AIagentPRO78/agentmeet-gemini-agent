/**
 * Rendering rules for room messages that go into the model prompt.
 *
 * Room text is written by other participants and is untrusted. The transcript
 * gives each message exactly one line that starts with a speaker label the kit
 * adds itself. Message text can never start a new line, so it cannot fake
 * another speaker's line (or the agent's own): line breaks inside a message
 * are replaced with a visible marker, and anything that looks like a speaker
 * label stays in the middle of the real sender's line.
 *
 * Message and transcript length are bounded so one participant cannot inflate
 * the prompt (and the bill) with oversized messages.
